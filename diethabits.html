       <h2>Diet and Habits</h2>
       <p>The diet of zebras mainly consists of grass. Shrubs, twigs, bark and leaves are also a part of their diet. Their digestive system and metabolism are such that they can thrive on a low-nutrition diet. They can digest coarse grasses which other herbivores can't. Thus zebras help other wild grazers by consuming coarse grass and leaving softer grass for them. They grip the grass with their lips and bite it off with their front teeth. They use their molars to grind the food.</p>
